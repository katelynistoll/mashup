# Mashup Project Assignment

* Build a site that uses data from at least one external API in an interesting, interactive way.


This project is a form of "Mad Libs." Rather than having the user input nouns, adjectives, and verbs (as with traditional Mad Libs), the user is prompted to input LOCATION, FOOD, PET, and DESSERT, as these categories are better represented with imagery.

Uses the Instagram API: User inputs a keyword and the API fetches the image that was most recently tagged with that keyword.

**WARNING:** This project pulls in the image most recently tagged with the matching keyword, which can be any image posted by anyone. There is no control over how relevant the actual image is to the keyword, or what the image is at all.
